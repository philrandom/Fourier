# Fourrier tracing

This is a personal project, where I code some small programs to help me understand better Fourrier Theory.

## `cmplx_circle.go`
This program is a reference to this [ video made by `3blue1brown` ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k)
You can admire some images that are outputs of this program.
